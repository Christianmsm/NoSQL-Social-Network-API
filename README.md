## Description
This application is a social network api that allows the user to complete various operations and user various routes to share their thoughts, add friends, and react to their friends thoughts. More information to come in a future version.

With this application I first set up the structure of all of the folders and files, then I went and created the various models and made sure that they were connecting to each other properly.

Then started setting up the basic routes so then I could move into working in the controller files. making sure that everything was functioning properly and I had all the correct routes that were discussed in the assignment readme.

I then started to add seed data into the collection so that way it can be used for testing of the various http requests.
